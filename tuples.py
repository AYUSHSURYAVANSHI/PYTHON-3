# tuple data structure 
# tuple can store any data type 
# most important tuple are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update 
# data inside tuple 

example = ('one','two','three')
# no append , no  insert , no, pop, no remove 

days = ('monday','tuesday')
# tuples are faster than lists

# methods
# count , index 
# len function 
# slicing  
# print(example[:2])

# can't do this
example[0] = 1
print(example)
